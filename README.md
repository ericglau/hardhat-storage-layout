# Sample Hardhat Project

This project provides a basic example of how to perform storage layout checks between two versions of an upgradeable smart contract.

## Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Copying the contracts

Copy the old and new versions of your contract into V1.sol and V2.sol, respectively. This can be flattened verified source code from Etherscan.

## Testing the contract

Adjust the contract names in `test/test.ts`. Then run:

```
npm test
```
